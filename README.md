Features:
- timer starts on entering any mission from Main Menu
- auto splits on completing a mission
- Load time removal (loads, menu and game exit time)
- IGT support (timer equals to game timer after every mission end).

Known issues:
- Game seems to be significantly slower in performance than the LiveSplit script execution. Sometimes race condition occurs. Maybe i'll find a solution later, temporary workaround built in for now (should work most of the time).
